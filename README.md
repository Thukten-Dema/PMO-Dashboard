### 📝 Project Description

**PMO Dashboard** is a real-time digital dashboard system developed for the Prime Minister’s Office to visualize national socio-economic, governance, and security-related indicators. It enables data-driven decision-making through dynamic charts, manual/API-based data uploads, role-based access control, and real-time notifications.

Key users such as the PM, ministers, and government officials can securely view and filter indicators across sectors (economic, social, governance), receive alerts, and download reports—helping modernize and centralize Bhutan’s national data infrastructure.

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Data Science & AI:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, PyTorch  
- **Other Tools:** Figma, Visual Studio Code, Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Security:** Two-Factor Authentication, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- **Data Integration:** RESTful APIs, Excel/CSV Bulk Upload, ETL Pipelines
